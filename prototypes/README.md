## Python Prototype (Reference Implementation)
Before implementing the high-performance C++ solver, a Python prototype was developed to validate the numerical schemes and the mathematical model.

* **Location:** [`prototypes/`](./prototypes)
* **Purpose:** Serves as a baseline for correctness. The C++ output is systematically compared against this Python implementation to ensure numerical accuracy (Unit Testing).
